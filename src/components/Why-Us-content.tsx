          communities of fellow makers, aspiring engineers, and outstanding
          computer scientists in the
          <b>boot camp</b>! The opportunity to interact with other students
          interested in technology is undoubtedly the most valuable perk.
          <i>Hack Club</i> is a fantastic social setting that is educational and
          enjoyable.

        <p className="ml-4">
          We foster a collaborative community of coders and makers, guiding them
          to apply their skills in a final group project. Members are grouped
          within their tracks to enhance teamwork, culminating in evaluations
          and presentations that refine their technical and communication
          skills. Explore these projects and more in Projects Section. (will be

        <p className="ml-4">
          Every season we do two hackathons: a project hackathon
          <i>(online)</i>
          and a competitive programming hackathon
          <i>(in-person)</i>. These hackathons help the young coders be ready
          for the final project and look inside at what they will see in the
          final project. In addition, they help in letting them know what the
          environment is like in the
          <b>Egyptian and International Olympiads of Informatics</b>.

          As we do not want to keep the
          <i>limits</i> to computer science and coding to these creative young
          students, we offer any member to share their graphic design skills in
          front of the community and teach how they do these pieces of designs.

          As we expect more from each maker in the club, we offered them
          something that makes
          <b>STEM Egypt Hack Club</b> unique from any other branch: doing a
          research project or writing an article related to computer science,
          <i>not just a Python file as a final project</i>. They can submit a
          manuscript to be featured on our website and approved and edited by
          our mentors who did many other research projects in top-notch programs
          <b>
            <i>(e.g., pioneer research program)</i>
          </b>
          . We also review their work to ensure that our content satisfies our

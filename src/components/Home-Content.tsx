        <h1 className="mb-3">What's a Hacker?</h1>
        <p>
          A hacker is not always someone who trespasses on banks or plunders a
          friend's V-Bucks. Hackers are individuals who identify problems that
          need to be solved and devise the most practical-efficient solutions.
          These issues frequently call for an inventive mentality, technological
          know-how, and exposure to new ideas. Many can be solved with computers
          or clever engineering. At STEM Egypt Hack Club, we want our hackers to
          be creative problem solvers who are also proficient in coding,
          engineering, and problem-solving.
          <br /> <br />
          Coding and computer science not only apply to specific problems - it
          fundamentally teaches how to solve complex problems using step-by-step
          logic. Coding teaches you how to dissect the issues and find
          solutions, so knowing it is valuable regardless of the job you end up
          choosing. STEM Egypt Hack Club cards are mainly focused on coding and
          engineering, including building unique-new software projects,
          protecting the community's network, conducting research projects and
          articles and much more!

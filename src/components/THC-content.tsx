          Teen Hack Challenge is an international competitive Programming
          Competition Founded and Organized by STEM Egypt Hack Club ºs
          Competitive Programming Council.

        <p className="ml-4">
          The competition will be in CPC style which means you have 8 problems
          with ranged difficulties to solve as fast as possible within 3 hours.
          The competition will be individual. All codes will be checked for AI
          detection and any overlapping between two codes will lead to immediate
          elimination.
